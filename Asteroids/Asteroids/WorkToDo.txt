Example

Name: Logan 
Progress: Assigned

Comments: none for now.

--CONNER
I added the rotation of the asteroids to the game
and the breakapart function that I made. (you said you wanted that)

///  CLASSIC MODE

Assigned to:  CONNER
Task: Impliment multiple levels by having more asteroids spawn when you destroy all the asteroids
Progress: DONE
Level: Easy
Comments: none, I tried to comment everything I did. :)

Assigned to:    LOGAN
Task: Assign score to asteroids and have it increment total score
Progress: DONE
Level:Easy
Comments: very simple. added reward to asteroid class and a little to Game::draw();


Assigned to:    Logan - E

Assigned to:  CONNER
Task: put all constants in this configureation file
Progress: DONE
Level: Simple
Comments: I took all the existing constants and put them into that file
			If there are more, just put them into that file when you make them.


Assigned to:  CONNER
Task: fix the breaking apart (medium asteroids are stopping)
Progress: DONE
Level: Good
Comments: I just took my break apart methods for large and medium asteroids
			and replaced your logic with mine. I hope that's what you wanted me
			to do. 


Assigned to:    LOGAN
Task: make the asteroids bounce off each other
Progress: dealing with bugs.
Level: between meh and high
Comments: Wrote an inbeded for loop with two iterators to go through each asteroid in Game::collisionCheck().
			the problem is that the iterator will get to the same asteroid and then see that the distance is 
			0 (becasue it's in the same place as itself).
			How do I loop through to check all the distances and not check as asteroids distance with itself?

Assigned to:  CONNER
Task: Sonic Boom
Progress: DONE
Level: easy?
Comments: I made sonic boom a class inheriting from bullet, I 
			don't know if that was the best choice with inheritance
			but otherwise, I'd have to make a new sonicboom list.
			Also, the sonicbooms don't wrap, do we want them to?

Assigned to:  CONNER
Task: Shotgun
Progress: DONE
Level: Hard
Comments: I just put shotgun into the game class (that's the only
			way it would work) and it works pretty well. It kind
			of slows down the game, should I try and change it to
			be one giant line that moves through or just keep in and
			put the limit of shotguns so that the user can't constantly
			slow down the game?
